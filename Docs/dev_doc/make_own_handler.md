# Create your own handlers in `loggingpython`
## Overview
`loggingpython` provides a flexible and extensible architecture that allows developers to create their own handlers to fulfill specific logging functionalities. This documentation will guide you through the process of creating your own handler, including the basics, a practical example and a summary of the benefits.

## Why create your own handlers?
Creating your own handlers allows you to customize the logging functionality of `loggingpython` to the specific requirements of your application. This can be particularly useful if the predefined handlers do not exactly meet your needs or if you want to implement a unique logging strategy. 

## Basics
A handler in `loggingpython` is a class that inherits from the base class `handler`. You need to override the `emit(self, record)` method, which is called when a log entry is generated. Within this method you can implement the logic to send the log entry to the desired destination.

## Example
Here is a simple example of a custom handler that writes log entries to a file:
```python
python from loggingpython.handler import Handler

class MyCustomHandler(Handler):
    def init(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

def emit(self, record):
    with open(self.filename, 'a') as file:
        file.write(f"{record.levelname}: {record.msg}\n")
```

 
## Use of your own handler
To use the created handler, you must add it to a logger:
```python
python from loggingpython import getLogger

logger = getLogger() my_handler = MyCustomHandler('my_log_file.log')
logger.addHandler(my_handler)
 
logger.info("This is an info message.")
```

## Summary
By creating your own handlers, you can customize the logging functionality of `loggingpython` to the specific requirements of your application. This allows you to process and store log entries in a way that best suits your project.

This section is intended to provide clear guidance and examples for developers who wish to extend `loggingpython`.

## Contribute to `loggingpython`
