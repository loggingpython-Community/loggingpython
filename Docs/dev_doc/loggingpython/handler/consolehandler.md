# Documentation for `ConsoleHandler.py`
## Overview
The `ConsoleHandler.py` file is part of the `loggingpython` package, which provides a simple and extensible way to integrate logging into Python applications. This documentation provides a detailed insight into the functionality and usage of the `ConsoleHandler` class defined in this file.

## `ConsoleHandler` Class
The `ConsoleHandler` class is responsible for handling log messages in the console. It inherits from the `Handler` class and implements specific methods for formatting and outputting log messages in the console. It supports the coloring of log messages based on their severity and allows customization of the formatting string. The `ConsoleHandler` ensures that log messages are displayed in real-time, making it suitable for debugging and monitoring applications during development or runtime.

## Initialization
A `ConsoleHandler` object is initialized with an optional stream and an optional formatting string for log messages. By default, `sys.stdout` is used as the stream and the formatting string contains the timestamp, the name of the logger, the severity of the log message, and the message itself.
```python
from loggingpython.handler.consolehandler import ConsoleHandler

console_handler = ConsoleHandler(stream=sys.stdout, logformat_string="%(asctime)s: [%(loggername)s]: [%(loglevel)s]: %(message)s")
```
## Variables
 - `stream`: The stream in which the log messages are written. By default `sys.stdout`.
 - `logformat_string`: The formatting string for the log messages.
 - `color_map`: A mapping of log levels to colors from colorama to color the log messages based on their severity.

## Methods
 - `emit(self, record: dict) -> None`: Outputs a formatted log message based on the passed log record.
 - `set_colors_for_levels(self, color_map: dict) -> None`: Sets colors for the different log levels.
 - `_get_color_for_level(self, loglevel: str) -> str`: Returns the color for a specific log level.
 - `_format_message(self, record: dict[str]) -> str`: Formats a log message based on the transferred log data record.

## Example
Here is a simple example of how to create a `ConsoleHandler`, add it to a logger, and log messages at different severity levels.
```python
from loggingpython.logger import Logger
from loggingpython.handler.consolehandler import ConsoleHandler

# Create a ConsoleHandler
console_handler = ConsoleHandler()

# Log a message
console_handler.emit({"loggername": "my_logger", "loglevel": "INFO", "message": "This is an information message."})
```

## Summary
The `ConsoleHandler` class in `ConsoleHandler.py` provides a robust and flexible way to display log messages in the console. By supporting different log levels and colors, the logging system can be adapted to the specific requirements of each application, making it suitable for both development and production environments.
