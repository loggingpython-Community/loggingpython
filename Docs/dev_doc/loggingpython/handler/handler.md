# Documentation for `handler.py`
## Overview
The `handler.py` file is a core component of the `loggingpython` package, providing a foundational class for all handlers within the logging system. This documentation offers a detailed explanation of the `Handler` class defined in this file, including its purpose, initialization, variables, and methods.

## `Handler` Class
The `Handler` class serves as the base class for all handlers in the `loggingpython` package. Handlers are responsible for processing and outputting log messages. This class defines the interface that all handler classes must adhere to, ensuring consistency across different types of handlers.

## Initialization
The `Handler` class does not require any initialization parameters. It serves as an abstract base class, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it provides a blueprint for other handler classes to inherit from.

## Variables
The `Handler` class does not define any instance variables. It is designed to be subclassed, with subclasses implementing their own variables as needed.

## Methods
`emit(self, record: dict[str]) -> None`
This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses to provide specific handling behavior for log messages. The base class raises a `NotImplementedError` to indicate that subclasses must implement this method.

```python
def emit(self, record: dict[str]) -> None:
    raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this!")
```

`__repr__(self) -> str`
Returns a string representation of the handler object. This method can be overridden by subclasses to provide a more informative representation.
```python
def __repr__(self) -> str:
    return "Handler()"
```

`__str__(self) -> str`
Returns a string representation of the handler object. This method can be overridden by subclasses to provide a more informative representation.
```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    return "Handler()"
```

## Example
Since the `Handler` class is an abstract base class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, let's consider an example of a subclass that inherits from `Handler`:
```python
class ConsoleHandler(Handler):
    def emit(self, record: dict) -> None:
        # Implementation for emitting log messages to the console
        pass

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "ConsoleHandler()"

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return "ConsoleHandler()"
```

In this example, `ConsoleHandler` inherits from Handler and provides its own implementation of the `emit` method, along with `__repr__` and `__str__` methods for a custom string representation.

## Summary
The `Handler` class in `handler.py` serves as the foundation for all handlers in the `loggingpytho`n package. By defining a common interface, it ensures that all handlers can be used interchangeably, providing flexibility and consistency in the logging system. Subclasses of `Handler` must implement the `emit` method to provide specific handling behavior for log messages.
