# Documentation for `handler_not_found_error.py`
## Overview
The `handler_not_found_error.py` file is a part of the `loggingpython` package, which provides a simple and extensible way to integrate logging into Python applications. This documentation offers a detailed insight into the functionality and usage of the `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class defined in this file.

## `HandlerNotFoundError` Exception Class
The `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class is responsible for indicating when a handler is not found in the logger's handlers. This error is raised to signal that the specified handler was not added to the logger, and therefore cannot be removed or manipulated further.

## Initialization
The `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class is initialized with a default message indicating that the handler was not found in the logger's handlers. However, it can be customized with a specific message when the exception is raised.
```python
class HandlerNotFoundError(ValueError):
    """
    Raised when a handler is not found in the logger's handlers.
    This error indicates that the specified handler was not added to the
    logger, and therefore cannot be removed.
    """
    def __init__(self,
                 message="Handler not found in logger's handlers.") -> None:
        super().__init__(message)
```

## Usage
The `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class can be used to handle scenarios where an attempt is made to remove or manipulate a handler that does not exist in the logger's handlers. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the application logic involves dynamic addition and removal of handlers, and it's crucial to ensure that handlers are correctly managed.
```python
try:
    # Attempt to remove a handler that does not exist
    logger.removeHandler(non_existent_handler)
except HandlerNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Example
Here is a simple example of how to use the `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class to handle a scenario where an attempt is made to remove a handler that does not exist in the logger's handlers.
```python

from loggingpython.error.handler_not_found_error import HandlerNotFoundError

def remove_handler(logger, handler):
    try:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    except HandlerNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Example usage
try:
    remove_handler(logger, non_existent_handler)
except HandlerNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates how the `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class can be used to signal and handle errors related to the incorrect management of handlers in the logging system. By raising this exception, the application can ensure that handlers are correctly managed, thereby preventing incorrect behavior and enhancing the robustness of the application's logging functionality.

## Summary
The `HandlerNotFoundError` exception class in `handler_not_found_error.py` provides a standardized way to indicate and handle errors related to the incorrect management of handlers in the logging system. By raising this exception, the application can ensure that handlers are correctly added, removed, and manipulated, thereby preventing incorrect behavior and enhancing the robustness of the application's logging functionality.
