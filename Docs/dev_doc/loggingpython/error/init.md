# Documentation for `__init__.py`
## Overview
The `__init__.py` file within the `loggingpython` package serves as an entry point for the package. It imports and exposes the various error classes available within the `loggingpython` package, providing a convenient way for users to access and utilize these errors for handling exceptions in their applications. This documentation provides a detailed insight into the functionalities and use of the classes and functions defined in this file.

## Imported Modules and Classes
The `__init__.py` file imports and exposes the following error classes:

`ServerUnreachableError`: Raised when the server is unreachable.
`ServerMethodCallError`: Raised when there is an error calling a method on the server.
`ClientMethodCallError`: Raised when there is an error calling a method on the client.
`InvalidLogLevelError`: Raised when an invalid log level is specified.
`InvalidHandlerMethodError`: Raised when an invalid handler method is called.
`HandlerNotFoundError`: Raised when a specified handler is not found.

## Functions
The `__init__.py` file does not define any functions. Instead, it focuses on importing and exposing the error classes for use by other parts of the `loggingpython` package or by applications using the package.

## Example
To use an error from the `error` module, you first need to import the specific error class you wish to use. Here's an example of how to import and use the `InvalidLogLevelError`:
```python
from loggingpython.error.invalid_log_level_error import InvalidLogLevelError

# Example usage
try:
    # Code that might raise an InvalidLogLevelError
    pass
except InvalidLogLevelError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Summary
The `__init__.py` file within the `error` folder plays a crucial role in the `loggingpython` package by providing a centralized location for importing and exposing the various error classes. This simplifies the process of handling exceptions in applications, allowing developers to easily integrate error handling functionality into their projects.
