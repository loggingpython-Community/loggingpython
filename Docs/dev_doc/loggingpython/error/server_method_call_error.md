# Documentation for `server_method_call_error.py`
## Overview
The file `server_method_call_error.py` is part of the `loggingpython` package, which provides a simple and extensible way to integrate logging into Python applications. This documentation provides a detailed insight into the functionality and usage of the `ServerMethodCallError` exception class defined in this file.

## `ServerMethodCallError` exception class
The `ServerMethodCallError` exception class is responsible for indicating when a method intended for the server is incorrectly called on the client. This error is raised to indicate that a method that should only be executed by the server has been incorrectly called by the client, which could result in incorrect behavior.

## Initialization
The `ServerMethodCallError` exception class is initialized with a default message indicating that the method can only be called by the server. However, it can be customized with a specific message when the exception is raised.
```python
class ServerMethodCallError(Exception):
    """ Raised when a method intended for the server is called on the client. This error indicates that a method that should only be executed by the server was incorrectly called by the client, which could lead to incorrect behavior. """
    def init(self, message="This method can only be called by the server."):
        super().init(message)
```

## Usage
The `ServerMethodCallError` exception class can be used to handle scenarios where a method intended for the server is incorrectly called on the client. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the application logic is designed to differentiate between client and server roles, and it is critical to ensure that methods are called in the correct context. 
```python
try: # Attempt to call a server-specific method on the client
    some_server_only_method()
except ServerMethodCallError as e:
    print(f "Error: {e}")
```

## Example
Here is a simple example of how the `ServerMethodCallError` exception class can be used to handle a scenario where a server-only method is incorrectly called on the client. 
```python
def some_server_only_method():
    raise ServerMethodCallError("This method should only be called by the server.")
try: # Attempt to call a server-specific method on the client 
    some_server_only_method()
except ServerMethodCallError as e:
    print(f "Error: {e}")
```
This example shows how the `ServerMethodCallError` exception class can be used to signal and handle errors related to the incorrect invocation of methods in the context of client-server communication within the `loggingpython` package.
## Summary
The `ServerMethodCallError` exception class in `server_method_call_error.py` provides a standardized way to indicate and handle errors related to the incorrect invocation of server-specific methods on the client. By throwing this exception, the application can ensure that methods are called in the correct context, preventing incorrect behavior and improving the robustness of the application logic
