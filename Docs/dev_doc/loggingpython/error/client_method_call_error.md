# Documentation for `client_method_call_error.py`
## Overview
The `client_method_call_error.py` file is a part of the `loggingpython` package, which provides a simple and extensible way to integrate logging into Python applications. This documentation offers a detailed insight into the functionality and usage of the `ClientMethodCallError` exception class defined in this file.

## `ClientMethodCallError` Exception Class
The `ClientMethodCallError` exception class is responsible for indicating when a method intended for the client is mistakenly called on the server. This error is raised to signal that a method that should only be executed by the client was incorrectly called by the server, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Initialization
The `ClientMethodCallError` exception class is initialized with a default message indicating that the method can only be called by the client. However, it can be customized with a specific message when the exception is raised.
```python
class ClientMethodCallError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when a method intended for the client is called on the server.
    This error indicates that a method that should only be executed by the
    client was mistakenly called by the server, which could lead to incorrect
    behavior.
    """
    def __init__(self,
                 message="This method can only be called by the client."):
        super().__init__(message)
```
## Usage
The `ClientMethodCallError` exception class can be used to handle scenarios where a method intended for the client is mistakenly called on the server. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the application logic is designed to differentiate between client and server roles, and it's crucial to ensure that methods are called in the appropriate context.
```python
try:
    # Attempt to call a client-only method on the server
    some_client_only_method()
except ClientMethodCallError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
## Example
Here is a simple example of how to use the `ClientMethodCallError` exception class to handle a scenario where a client-only method is mistakenly called on the server.
```python
def some_client_only_method():
    raise ClientMethodCallError("This method should only be called by the client.")

try:
    # Attempt to call a client-only method on the server
    some_client_only_method()
except ClientMethodCallError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
This example demonstrates how the `ClientMethodCallError` exception class can be used to signal and handle errors related to incorrect method calls in the context of client-server communication within the `loggingpython` package.

## Summary
The `ClientMethodCallError` exception class in `client_method_call_error.py `provides a standardized way to indicate and handle errors related to the incorrect calling of client-only methods on the server. By raising this exception, the application can ensure that methods are called in the appropriate context, thereby preventing incorrect behavior and enhancing the robustness of the application's logic.
