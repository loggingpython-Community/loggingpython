Enum class that represents the TCP and UDP system protocols.

This class defines two enum members: TCP and UDP, which represent the
corresponding values from the socket module. TCP stands for Transmission
Control Protocol and is used for connection-oriented services, while UDP
stands for User Datagram Protocol and is used for connectionless services.
