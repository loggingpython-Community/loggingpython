`loggingpython`

A class for handling log messages over a network connection.

This class inherits from the Handler class and implements specific methods
for sending and receiving log messages over a network connection. It
supports both client and server modes, allowing for the establishment of
connections, sending log messages, and handling incoming messages. The
class provides decorators to ensure that certain methods can only be
called by the client or server, enforcing the correct usage of the handler.
It also includes error handling for scenarios such as server
unreachability and incorrect method calls.
